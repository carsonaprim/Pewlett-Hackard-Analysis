# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
##Overview
The goal of this analysis was to take the data given for the specified company, and to perform various evaluations generally revolved around the concept of retirement. Some of the things we did were combining various csv files and drawing specific date from each, with the finale including a compound version of combining 3 csv files. We learned how to call specific data and how to use count and group by functions in pgAdmin.
##Results
- The company is in a good place, only two of the managerial staff are in line to retire
- The ratio of senior staff and engineer to normal staff is very high, meaning there is ample opportunity to move up in the company
- There is a large variety of jobs included in the staff eligible for mentorship, with all job titles being covered
- No shortage of mentorship eligible staff as there are over 1000 available for the program
##Summary
There will be a significant number of roles that need to be filled, as a large variety of the jobs are being left vacant, as shown here

I estimate 75000 but that does not account for any growth
As for mentorship I am providing a image of the table with a random selection of 6 possible mentors all with various titles and towards the middle of the data set, with the row numbers in the 900/1500's there are a significant amount of mentors, but perhaps not enough to hire 75000 people
